# EscapeeTracker

## Overview
EscapeeTracker is a VBA Excel-based tool designed to streamline the process of tracking shipments potentially without a valid customs release. Originally developed to aid coworkers tasked with identifying such "escapees" from SAP data, this tool has transformed the labor-intensive process into a swift and automated task.

## How it Works
1. **Automated Tracking:** Users paste the SAP data into Excel. With a simple click on 'RUN', the tool automatically tracks each shipment's status across multiple platforms.
2. **Quick Status Verification:** EscapeeTracker integrates various logistics data directly into Excel, enabling the immediate identification of shipments that have escaped without the necessary customs release.

## Key Benefits
- **Massive Time Savings:** What used to take 2-3 minutes per shipment to manually verify now takes a fraction of the time. For instance, tracking about 1000 shipments for the month of April only took 50 minutes, a task that would have previously occupied an entire shift or more.
- **Enhanced Accuracy:** Automates tracking and reduces human error in the verification process.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy to use with minimal training required.
